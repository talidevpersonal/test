is submitted.

   Steps:
   1. Create a new rule (e.g., "Form Submission").
   2. Add an **Event**:
      - Event Type: `Submit`
      - Element Selector: `form` (or a more specific selector for your form).
   3. Add an **Action**:
      - Action Type: `Send Beacon`
      - Set the Adobe Analytics variables (e.g., `event3` for "Form Submitted").

---

### 6. **Track Field Interactions**
   - Use event rules to track individual field interactions (e.g., focus, change).

   Steps:
   1. Create a new rule (e.g., "Field Focus").
   2. Add an **Event**:
      - Event Type: `Focus`
      - Element Selector: `input, textarea, select` (or a more specific selector for your fields).
   3. Add an **Action**:
      - Action Type: `Send Beacon`
      - Set the Adobe Analytics variables (e.g., `event4` for "Field Focused").
   4. Repeat for `Change` events to track field value changes.

---

### 7. **Use Data Elements for Dynamic Values**
   - Use Adobe Launch's **Data Elements** to dynamically capture field values or other form data.

   Example:
   1. Create a Data Element for a field value:
      - Data Element Type: `CSS Selector`
      - Selector: `input[name="email"]`
      - Value: `value`
   2. Use this Data Element in your event rules to send the field value to Adobe Analytics.

---

### 8. **Test and Debug**
   - Use Adobe Experience Platform Debugger to verify that events are being triggered and data is being sent correctly.
   - Check the network requests to ensure the Adobe Analytics beacons are firing as expected.

---

### 9. **Advantages of This Approach**
   - No changes required to your React code.
   - Centralized tracking logic in Adobe Launch.
   - Easy to update or modify tracking rules without redeploying your application.

---

### 10. **Best Practices**
   - Use descriptive event names and variable values for easier analysis in Adobe Analytics.
   - Test thoroughly to ensure all form interactions are tracked correctly.
   - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) by informing users and obtaining consent if required.

Yes, you can implement Adobe Analytics in a React.js app without installing any packages by directly using Adobe Launch (Tag Manager) or the Adobe Analytics JavaScript library (AppMeasurement.js).

Method 1: Using Adobe Launch (Recommended)
Get Your Adobe Launch Embed Code

Go to Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection.
Create a new Launch property and add Adobe Analytics.
Publish the property and get the JavaScript snippet.
Add Launch Script in index.html
Open public/index.html and add this inside <head>:

<script src="https://assets.adobedtm.com/your-launch-script.js" async></script>
(Replace your-launch-script.js with your actual script URL.)

Track Events in React Components
Since Adobe Launch loads _satellite, use it inside React:

const trackEvent = (eventName, data = {}) => {
  if (window._satellite) {
    window._satellite.track(eventName, data);
  } else {
    console.warn("Adobe Launch is not available.");
  }
};

const handleClick = () => {
  trackEvent("button_click", { button: "signup" });
};
<button onClick={handleClick}>Sign Up</button>
Track Page Views (React Router) Modify App.js to track page views:

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

const trackPageView = (pageName) => {
  if (window.s) {
    window.s.pageName = pageName;
    window.s.t();
  }
};

const AnalyticsTracker = () => {
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    trackPageView(location.pathname);
  }, [location]);

  return null;
};

export default AnalyticsTracker;
Add <AnalyticsTracker /> inside App.js.

Method 2: Using Adobe AppMeasurement.js
If you don't want to use Adobe Launch, you can directly add Adobe’s AppMeasurement.js.

Get AppMeasurement.js

Download from Adobe Admin Console under Analytics.
Host it yourself or load it in index.html:
<script src="https://yourdomain.com/AppMeasurement.js"></script>
Initialize Adobe Analytics in React Add this to analytics.js:

window.s_account = "your_report_suite"; // Adobe Analytics account
window.s = new AppMeasurement();
window.s.trackingServer = "your-tracking-server.com";
window.s.track();
Track Events

const trackEvent = (event, data = {}) => {
  if (window.s) {
    window.s.events = event;
    Object.keys(data).forEach((key) => {
      window.s[key] = data[key];
    });
    window.s.tl(true, "o", event);
  }
};
Which Method Should You Choose?
Method	Pros	Cons
Adobe Launch	No need to modify React code often, easier updates	Requires Adobe Launch setup
AppMeasurement.js	Direct control over tracking	Requires manual implementation
Recommendation: Adobe Launch is better for maintainability, while AppMeasurement.js is useful if you want full control without Adobe Launch.

Improved Adobe Launch Setup: Track Form Field Interactions & Abandonment
This setup will track:
✔ Field Interactions – When a user types in a form field.
✔ Form Abandonment – When a user starts filling the form but leaves without submitting.

Step 1: Create a Rule for Tracking Field Interactions
Go to Adobe Launch → Rules → Create New Rule.

Set Rule Details:

Name: "Track Form Field Interaction"
Event Type: Core → Change
Element Selector:
Target all form inputs → input, textarea, select
Or track a specific form → #signupForm input
Set Adobe Analytics Variables

Action → Adobe Analytics – Set Variables
eVar & Events Configuration:
eVar10 = %this.value% (Field value)
eVar11 = %this.name% (Field name)
event10 = Field Interaction
Send Analytics Data

Action → Adobe Analytics – Send Beacon
Select s.tl() ("Track Link")
Step 2: Track Form Abandonment
Approach:
Track if a user starts typing but does not submit the form.
Trigger when the user leaves the page or clicks outside the form.
Steps to Implement:
Create Another Rule:

Rule Name: "Track Form Abandonment"
Event Type:
Core → Blur (When a user clicks outside the form)
Core → Window Unload (When they close or leave the page)
Set Conditions:

Condition Type: "Data Element Exists"
Data Element: Check if the form was interacted with (Example: formStarted = true).
Set Adobe Analytics Variables

Action → Adobe Analytics – Set Variables
eVar12 = "Form Abandoned"
event11 = Form Abandonment
Send Analytics Data

Action → Adobe Analytics – Send Beacon
Use s.tl() to track the abandonment event.
Step 3: Define Data Elements for Form Interaction
Create a Data Element in Adobe Launch:

Name: "formStarted"
Type: JavaScript Variable
Code:
var form = document.querySelector("#signupForm"); 
form.addEventListener("input", function() { 
  window.formStarted = true; 
});
Step 4: Test & Validate in Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger
Fill the form and check "Field Interaction" events in the debugger.
Leave the form without submitting and verify the "Form Abandonment" event fires.
Why Use This Approach?
✔ No Code Changes in React.js – All tracking is managed in Adobe Launch.
✔ Accurate Tracking – Prevents false positives by ensuring a user started filling the form.
✔ Scalable – Works for multiple forms without code updates.
